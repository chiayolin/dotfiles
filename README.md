# Dotfiles ~/*.

My dot files shared between machines for Bash, Linux, and OSX.

## Installing

``` bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/chiayolin/dotfiles` 
```
Pass `--recursive` to `git clone` so you can clone the project with submodule(s). 

Run `install-dotfiles.sh` to install dot files. Or you can copy these to ~/ one by one.
