By running `strap.sh install`, some of the existing dotfiles on your \r\nmachine may be removed and replaced with the symlinks to the dotfiles provided by \r\nthis repository. _Use and install these dotfiles at your own risk_.\r\n\r\nClone the repository to wherever you want. The below example keeps the repositry\r\nin `$HOME/Dotfiles/` (the uppercase 'D' in 'Dotfiles' gives the home directory\r\na more consistent look since most of the stock folders start with uppercase\r\nletters):\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/chiayolin/dotfiles.git $HOME/Dotfiles/\r\n```\r\n\r\nInitialise the repository with its submodules (e.g. plugins for\r\nshell and vim), and get everythng up to date by running \r\n`strap.sh update`:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ sh strap.sh update # pulling updates from upstream\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo install the dotfiles, run `sh strap.sh install`:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ sh strap.sh install\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, update and install the dotfiles in one step:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ sh strap.sh update && sh strap.sh install\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecute `strap.sh` with no argument for help and usage:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ sh strap.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Rundown\r\n\r\nThis repository is structured as the directory tree shown below:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n.\r\n├── formulae        # the dotfiles are stored here\r\n│   ├── _include    # shared configuation files\r\n│   │   └── _bin    # script(s) that the dotfiles will run\r\n│   └── ...         # the configuation files/directories\r\n└── packages        # rules for installing packages\r\n    └── ...         # dirs containing rules for each package\r\n```\r\n\r\n### `formulae/`\r\nThe directory `formulae/` contains the dotfiles. Therefore, every file inside \r\nthis directory will be symlinked to `$HOME` after the process of installation \r\nis completed (after running `sh strap.sh install`). The symlinks inside \r\n`$HOME` are _dotfiles_ with their original file extensions removed:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nformulae/zshrc.sh -> $HOME/.zshrc\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe shared configuation files are stored under `_formulae/_include`. Take a \r\nlook at this directory to get an idea of what kind of files would belong to\r\nhere. Futhermore, scripts or binary used by the dotfiles are placed under\r\n`_formulae/_include/_bin`. \r\n\r\n### `packages/`\r\n\r\nThis diectory is consisted of subdirectories containing installation scripts\r\nfor each supported operating system. The defined packages under `packages/`\r\ncan be installed by running `strap.sh install-pkg`. However, this feature is \r\nstill under development, so only macOS is currently supported.\r\n\r\nEach subdirectory of `packages/` is named using the name of a specific package and \r\ncontains a couple of files, that among them are, a file with `.info` as its file\r\nextension and files that contains rules for installing this package on differnet \r\noperating system. The tree shown below is an exmaple of a subdirectory containing\r\nrules for installing `archey`:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\narchey\r\n├── archey.darwin\r\n├── archey.ubuntu\r\n├── ...\r\n└── archey.info\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen `strap.sh install-pkg` is executed, `strap.sh` will look into every\r\nsubdirectory inside `packages/` for a file ends with `.info` and run it.\r\n`strap.sh` will proceed to determine the current operating system running on \r\nthe machine. And based upon the result, for instance, `strap.sh` will look for \r\n`archey.darwin` if the machine is running macOS or `archey.ubuntu` if the\r\noperating system is Ubuntu and etc. Every file under each subdirectory is just\r\na regular shell script that automates the process of installing a package.\r\n\r\n## Author\r\n\r\n[![Chiayo Lin](https://img.shields.io/badge/author-Chiayo%20Lin-green.svg)](mailto:chiayo.lin@gmail.com)\r\n\r\nAny patches or pull-requests are more than welcome :)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chiayolin/dotfiles/master/LICENSE.txt)\r\n> \"The code is dedicated, in respect and admiration, to the spirit that lives in\r\n   the computer\" ~ Alan J.
